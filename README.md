# Duke's Item Pack

This item pack mod adds unique ideas I had for *The Binding of Isaac: Repentance*. Every item is designed to introduce fresh mechanics, interesting synergies, or completely new gameplay twists, while staying lore-friendly and balanced within the game's design.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ§© Custom items with original mechanics  
- ðŸ§  Unique synergies with vanilla content  
- ðŸ§ª Creative and experimental effects  
- ðŸ”§ Actively maintained and updated

## ðŸ”® Current Items

- **Malediction** â€“ Mark enemies and detonate the curse for bonus damage  
- **Schizophrenia** â€“ A psychological twist with unpredictable effects  
- **Critical Hit** â€“ Deals damage based on tear height  
- **Wind-Up Key** â€“ Spin Isaac's head around and charge it up for a spiral of tears
- **And More!**

## ðŸ”§ Scripting

This mod uses Lua scripting to implement all its logic and behavior.

## ðŸ§  Inspiration

Some items are based on psychological or abstract concepts, aiming to blend gameplay mechanics with thematic ideas. The goal is to create items that feel **fresh**, **fun**, and sometimes a little **weird**.
