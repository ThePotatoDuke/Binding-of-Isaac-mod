    <description>This mod adds random item ideas I had to the game. It includes 6+ items . The items
        can be encountered in devil deal, secret, boss and secret item pools.

        Future plans:
        -Better balancing as of the first version of the mod.In the first version the items are
        unbalanced due to my inability to find testers.
        - Synergies for items like Wind-Up Key and Critical hit.
        -Maybe more items in the future if I have some new ideas.

        I have not tested the mod for multiplayer yet, it is possibly buggy.If you find any bugs
        please let me know.

        That's all, hope you enjoy :)
