    <description>This mod adds random item ideas I had to the game. It includes 6 items (5 passive, 1 active). The items can be encountered in devil deal, secret, boss and secret item pools.

Future plans:
-Better balancing as of the first version of the mod.In the first version the  items are unbalanced due to my inability to find testers.
- Synergies for items like Wind-Up Key and Critical hit.
-Maybe more items in the future if I have some new ideas.

I have not tested the mod for multiplayer yet, it is possibly buggy.If you find any bugs please let me know.

 That's all, hope you enjoy :)</description>
